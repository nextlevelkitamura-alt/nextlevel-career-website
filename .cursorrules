1.  **`palns/AI_GUIDELINES.md`** (The Constitution)
    - Understand the rules, the 3-layer structure, and your responsibilities.
2.  **`palns/PROJECT_MASTER.md`** (The Map)
    - Grasp the project architecture, tech stack, and directory structure.
3.  **`palns/DAILY_TASK.md`** (The Current State)

## 🔌 MCP CONFIGURATION
This project uses the Supabase MCP Server.
- Use `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from `.env.local` to connect.

## ⚡️ YOUR MISSION
- Always update `DAILY_TASK.md` before and after your work.
- Use Japanese for all documentation and communication.
- Focus on the "Current Task" defined in `DAILY_TASK.md`.
